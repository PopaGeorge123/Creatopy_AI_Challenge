# Creatopy_AI_Challenge
## A repository that contains the solution to Creatopy`s Challenge

I enjoy the fact that I had the opportunity to code an application, and it turned out to be a rewarding and enjoyable experience. The process of crafting the app allowed me to delve into the intricacies of development, applying my skills and knowledge to bring a concept to life. Despite the challenges along the way, each problem solved and feature implemented provided a sense of accomplishment. This coding journey not only enhanced my technical abilities but also fostered a deep appreciation for the creative and problem-solving aspects of software development. Overall, it was a fulfilling and enriching experience that further fueled my passion for coding. 

**The features I implemented and why I chose them:**
  * I liked my solution to be one easy to use for everyone. It contains a simple and intuitive interface. All the have to do is to write a detailed description of the ad he wants to generate.
  * When generating Title Image Description and Call To Action I designed 4 different requests to the API so the response could be more variated. I an councious about greater data consumption but it is worth it.
  * To speed up the development process I used nodemon module. Structured code into Server and Client side.


**Challenges I faced and how I overcame them.**
  * I struggled with setting each template aspect ratio acording to each style class. After a few searches online , i finally achived what I expected.
  * Other problem i faced was CORS Error I got on the frontend side: it wasn t enable cross origin requests, so I finally solve this problem with line "app.use(cors());" in server.js file.


**If i had more time to accomplish this task, i would:**
  * Work more on the design of the application. Make it responsive for all types of devices
  * Would implement capability that user could edit any content of the ad including position, size , colour and font famillies.

## In the ScreenShot folder there are some examples of the app.
