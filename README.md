# Creatopy_AI_Challenge
A repository that contains the solution to Creatopy`s Challenge

>>The features I implemented and why you chose them:
  I liked my solution to be one easy to use for everyone. It contains a simple and intuitive interface. All the have to do is to write a detailed description of the ad he wants to generate.
  When generating Title Image Description and Call To Action I designed 4 different requests to the API so the response could be more variated. I an councious about greater data consumption but it is worth it.

>>Challenges I faced and how you overcame them.
  I struggled with setting each template aspect ratio acording to each style class. After a few searches online , i finally achived what I expected.
  Other problem i faced was CORS Error I got on the frontend side: it wasn t enable cross origin requests, so I finally solve this problem with line "app.use(cors());" in server.js file.

>>If i had more time to accomplish this task, i would:
  Work more on the design of the application. Make it responsive for all types of devices
  Would implement capability that user could edit any content of the ad including position, size , colour and font famillies.
